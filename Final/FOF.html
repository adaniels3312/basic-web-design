            <h2>YOU COULD BE A SUPERHUMAN</h2>
            <p>Being a superhumanly healthy person means more than just hitting the gym or eating your greens—its a
                full-spectrum lifestyle rooted in balance, consistency, and self-awareness. Its waking up with purpose,
                fueling your body with nutrient-dense foods, staying hydrated, getting quality sleep, and moving every
                day in ways that challenge and energize you. Mental clarity is just as vital, so practicing mindfulness,
                managing stress, and cultivating strong relationships are non-negotiables. A superhumanly healthy person
                doesn’t chase perfection—they aim for progress, listening to their body, respecting its limits, and
                optimizing it through smart, sustainable choices that enhance longevity, vitality, and joy.</p>



            <h1>Fruit Means Everything</h1>

            <img src="images/ice fruit.jpg" alt="berries">
            <p>its natures sweetest gift, bursting with color, flavor, and life. From the crisp snap of an apple to the
                juicy drip of a ripe mango, fruit represents abundance and joy. It nourishes our bodies with essential
                vitamins, hydrates us with natural juices, and energizes us without the need for anything artificial.
                Across the world, fruit is more than just food—it's part of culture, tradition, and celebration. It
                connects people to the earth, to seasons, and to each other, whether its shared in a bowl at breakfast
                or offered as a gesture of kindness.</p>


            <h2>Fruit Beats All Food</h2>
            <img src="images/" alt="">
            <p>Beyond its taste and nutrition, fruit symbolizes life’s richness. In many cultures, it's a sign of
                prosperity, love, and growth. A single seed can become a tree that bears fruit for generations—there’s
                something deeply poetic about that. Fruit reminds us to enjoy the present moment, to savor sweetness,
                and to stay rooted while growing forward. It’s a simple thing, yet full of meaning, making it something
                truly special—something that, in its quiet way, can mean everything.</p>
